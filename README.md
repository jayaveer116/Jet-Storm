# Jet-Storm
Jet Storm is a high-octane aerial combat and survival game developed at the lowest levels of the computing stack. Built using the Jack high-level language and compiled into Hack VM code as part of the Nand2Tetris curriculum, this project demonstrates a deep understanding of hardware-software integration.


✈️ Jet Storm: Low-Level Aerial Combat
Jet Storm is a retro-style side-scrolling shooter engineered from the ground up using the Nand2Tetris software stack. Developed in the Jack object-oriented language and executed on the Hack Virtual Machine, this project showcases the implementation of complex game logic, collision physics, and real-time rendering on a simulated 16-bit computer architecture.

🌟 Key Features
Low-Level Systems Engineering: Developed entirely within the Nand2Tetris ecosystem, utilizing custom-built compilers and virtual machine architectures.

Dynamic Combat System: Implemented a responsive projectile engine allowing the player to fire bullets while managing cooldowns and ammo sets.

Autonomous Enemy AI: Features an EnemyManager that handles the spawning and movement logic for hostile jets, creating a scaling difficulty curve.

Real-Time Collision Detection: Precise coordinate-based checks ensure accurate interactions between the player's jet, enemy units, and projectiles.

State Persistence: Includes a high-score tracking system and a dedicated game-over sequence to manage session cycles.

🚀 Usage
To run Jet Storm on the Hack Platform:

Compile: Use the Nand2Tetris JackCompiler to translate the .jack files into .vm files.

Load: Open the VMEmulator provided in the Nand2Tetris suite.

Execute: Load the directory containing the compiled VM code and set the animation speed to "No Animation" for optimal performance.
